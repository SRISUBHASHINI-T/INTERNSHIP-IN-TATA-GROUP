# 💼 Tata Group Internship – Revenue Analysis

## 📌 Overview
As part of my internship with **Tata Group**, I worked on analyzing revenue data across multiple cities in the United States. The objective was to evaluate monthly sales performance, identify high- and low-revenue cities, and provide recommendations for improving overall revenue generation. This project emphasized balancing revenue between strong-performing and underperforming regions.  

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Track **month-wise revenue trends** to identify seasonal patterns.  
- Compare revenue generation across cities (e.g., California and other major US locations).  
- Highlight top-performing cities contributing the most revenue.  
- Identify cities with declining or low revenue for targeted improvement.  
- Provide actionable recommendations for increasing revenue in underperforming areas.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel** → Data cleaning, monthly sales ratio calculations  
- **Power BI** → Dashboards and revenue visualizations  
- **DAX Functions** → KPI creation and comparative metrics  

## 📊 Process
1. **Data Cleaning**: Standardized city names, removed duplicates, and organized revenue records by month.  
2. **Trend Analysis**: Evaluated month-wise sales ratios to observe seasonal changes in revenue.  
3. **Geographic Analysis**: Segmented data by city and compared revenue distribution.  
4. **Visualization**: Designed dashboards in Power BI to track revenue contribution across locations.  
5. **Insights**: Highlighted cities with consistent growth and identified low-revenue cities needing attention.  

## 📈 Outcome
- Identified high-revenue cities (e.g., California and other top-performing regions).  
- Detected cities with lower contributions, helping management focus on targeted improvements.  
- Balanced strategy proposed for both high- and low-revenue regions.  
- Provided actionable insights to support better decision-making and revenue growth.
